<p>I’ve already answered the questions for this part on the home page, so this space will be dedicated to assembling the audio files.  There are 7 audio files, every audio file has two numbers associated with it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The number in the filename. 0-7 skipping 4</li>
  <li>The <em>track</em> number in the metadata. 1-7.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can pull the track numbers via exiftool.  Yes, that tool to view exif data from images also handles pretty much every other file aswell!  I ran <code class="highlighter-rouge">exiftool *.mp3 | grep 'Name\|Track'</code> to show me all the track numbers associated with the files.  The | in my grep command, just means “OR”, it comes in really handy.</p>

<p>I combined all the audio files based upon their track number with ffmpeg.  I could of gone straight to an audio editing program such as Audacity or GarageBand, but I find combining files via command line easier than dragging stuff around on a timeline.  The command to combine is:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">ffmpeg -i "concat:discombobulatedaudio1.mp3|discombobulatedaudio2.mp3|discombobulatedaudio3.mp3|debug-20161224235959-0.mp3|discombobulatedaudio5.mp3|discombobulated-audio-6-XyzE3N9YqKNH.mp3|discombobulatedaudio7.mp3" -c copy out.mp3</code>.</p>

<p>Playing the audio file within VLC, I was able to understand “Merry Christmas Santa &lt;jibberish&gt; Jeff”, it was also apparent that the clip had been slowed down.</p>

<p>I downloaded Audacity which is a great tool for editing Audio Files.  The first step is to import the audio file into audacity (File &gt; Import).  Once imported, we can now start playing with the effects we know the audio is slowed down so naturally I attempted the “Change speed” effect first.  I chose to make it 7x the speed because there are 7 audio files.  There’s no technical merrit behind that reasoning, just thought that if I was tasked to slowdown and cut up the video files I’d choose the same number.  After changing the speed the pitch of the audio was too high to make out a single word.</p>

<p>Looking through the effects again, I saw the “Change Tempo” had a description of “Increase Tempo without Changing Pitch”.  I ran this one with a 700 percent increase and was now able to make out every word: “Merry Christmas Santa Claus, as I’ve always known him Jeff.” which was the passphrase to the final door and lead to The Doctor.</p>

<p>The audio was grabbed from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedD40sEb8M&amp;t=78s">The Doctor Who special of 2012</a>.</p>
